# LLM From Scratch ğŸš€

## ğŸ§± Current Progress

### 1. Bigram Model
- ğŸ““ Notebook: [`bigram`](bigram_model.ipynb)
- ğŸ§  A simple character-level bigram language model implemented from scratch both neural network and lookup table based .

### 2. MLP-based Character Model
- ğŸ““ Paper followed: [`Bengio et al. 2003`](extras/mlp_paper.pdf)
- ğŸ”§ Multi-layer perceptron-based character-level neural net with character wise Embedding Vectors.
